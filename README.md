# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This project uses logistic regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a dataset. The model is trained using a split of the data into training and test sets, and its performance is measured by accuracy and ROC AUC. Additionally, the code calculates odds ratios for each independent variable to assess their impact on the final outcome.

## Features
- Predicts heart disease using logistic regression.
- Visualizes the ROC Curve to evaluate model performance.
- Calculates odds ratios to understand the influence of different variables.

## How to Use
1. Upload the `heartdiseases.csv` dataset.
2. Run the Python script to train the model and generate predictions.
3. Review the accuracy and ROC Curve results to evaluate the model's performance.
